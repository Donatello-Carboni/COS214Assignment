This repository contains the source code and documentation for a restaurant simulator project for the COS 214 course at the University of Pretoria. The project aims to demonstrate the application of various design patterns in a complex system.

## Project Description

The project simulates a restaurant that has two distinct areas: the floor and the kitchen. The floor is where customers are seated, managed, and served by waiters and managers. The kitchen is where orders are prepared by different chefs at different stations and then sent to the floor. The restaurant is a "Build-Your-Own" restaurant, meaning that customers can create their own orders from a list of available options and request specific methods of preparation.

The project also incorporates features such as:

- A booking system or walk-in based service
- Customer expectations and satisfaction
- Bill splitting and tab creation
- Chefs, waiters, and managers visiting tables
- A bar with various cocktails
- A valet service
- Inventory and accounting
